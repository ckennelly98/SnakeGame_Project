# SnakeGame_Project

The SnakeGame.java project was a simple version of the famous retro game "Snake" that was written by my professor, and I was instructed to alter the code to meet specific requirements to complete the assignment. I had altered the code to include a poison pellet so that if the snake eats it the game ends, if the snake runs into itself the game ends, if the snake eats 20 pellets then the player wins the game, to include more than one food pellet at a time, and for the snake to get faster after each pellet eaten.
